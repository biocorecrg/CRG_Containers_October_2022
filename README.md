## About the course

This slow-paced hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using Linux Containers ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Singularity](https://www.apptainer.org/)).

### Outline

The course will train participants to run and build Linux containers.

It is designed to provide trainees with short and frequent hands-on sessions, while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum.

Trainees will work in a dedicated [AWS environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS).


### Learning objectives

* Locate and fetch Docker/Singularity images from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Docker/Singularity container from the command line.
* Build simple Docker container images

### Prerequisite / technical requirements

Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.
Knowledge of containers is not mandatory. The course materials is online in the dedicated GitHub page for self-learning.

Practitioners will need to connect during the course to a remote server via the "ssh" protocol. You can learn about it [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work)

Those who follow the course should be able to use a command-line/screen-oriented text editor (such as nano or vi/vim, which are already available on the server) or to be able to use an editor able to connect remotely. For sake of information, below the basics of "nano":
